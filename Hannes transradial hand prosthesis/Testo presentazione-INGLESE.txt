Introduction to Hannes: 

The Hannes prosthetic hand, developed collaboratively by INAIL and the Italian Institute of Technology(IIT) through Rehab Technologies, stands out as a sophisticated under-actuated poly-articulated device. Renowned for its leader-follower wire configuration governing finger movements, the hand pays tribute to Professor Hannes Schmidl, a trailblazer in prosthetic research at the Prosthesis Center of Vigorso di Budrio and the innovator behind the inaugural myoelectric prosthesis in 1965.

Its powertrain comprises a singular DC motor coupled with a custom planetary gearhead, enabling intricate grasping movements. Controlled via a position reference (ϑref) derived from the user’s EMG signals, a magnetic encoder measures the hand drive train's slow shaft position (ϑout) to attain the desired grasp configuration. The control system employs proportional–integrative–derivative (PID) controllers, with an outer position-based loop (PD) and an inner current-based loop (PI). However, limited sensing capability restricts Hannes to measuring only motor-side current and position. [testo slides + Chat]

Concepts and Goals:

Numerous studies have aimed to delineate key factors characterizing human hand behavior, focusing on anthropomorphic features, performance metrics, and synergistic grasping dynamics. To harness these insights, we conceived Hannes, a prosthetic hand meticulously designed to amalgamate biomimicry and functionality through a co-design process involving researchers, patients, orthopedists, and industrial designers. Our objective revolves around achieving superior performance in anthropomorphism, biomimetic prowess, and human-like grasping behavior, surpassing existing prosthetic devices. [testo slides + Chat]

Generic Structure:

Hannes comprises three primary components: a myoelectric poly-articulated prosthetic hand featuring a differential underactuated mechanism, a passive flexion-extension (F/E) wrist module, and a myoelectric interface/controller housing sEMG sensors, a battery pack, and control electronics. These components synergistically embody anthropomorphism, biomimetic performance, and realistic grasping dynamics, pivotal for a prosthesis' overall efficacy. The integrated architecture strategically embeds the DC motor and motor control board within the hand while situating the sEMG-based controller in the socket, with the F/E wrist module bridging these components, culminating in a holistic biomimetic design approach.

Kinematic Structure:

Anthropomorphic analysis of Hannes highlights its faithful replication of human hand dimensions and kinematics, albeit with a slight approximation in fixing the digits' distal DOFs. Notably, the negligible functional contribution of the DIP joint underscores Hannes' exceptional anthropomorphism, surpassing even advanced devices like the Michelangelo prosthesis. Additionally, the prosthetic hand's weight of 480 g closely mirrors its biological counterpart, enhancing its realism. [testo slides + Chat]

Mechanical Structure:

[The Hannes system contains four main components: an electric actuator (DC motor), two custom-made control boards (Motor control board and EMG processing board), two EMG sensors implementing a proportional dual-site control and a tendon-driven, underactuated transmission mechanism (Fig.  2). Te embedded diferential system is capable to properly ofer the patient a harmonious, quick, and precise grasping behaviour. Te passive Flexion/Extension fexible wrist, separately placed at the base of the prosthetic hand to guarantee system modularity, can be fxed in fve diferent positions (two for fexion, two for extension and one for neutral position) or left free. In addition, the wrist module ofers several discrete positions in Pronation/Supination with a 360° mechanical and electrical slip ring connection. Finally, a passive thumb can be locked in three positions to allow the main grasp types: lateral, power and pinch. All these features were implemented to develop Hannes as a prosthetic system uniquely similar to the real human hand, as it is detailed in reference.] [preso dal paper:"s12984-022-01046-y]

Hannes integrates critical components within its palm, housing an electric actuator, a control board, sensors, and the transmission mechanism. The base hosts the F/E extension flexible wrist. The powertrain comprises a compact, high-power-density DC motor coupled with a custom-made hypocycloid gearbox. Utilizing leader and follower wires, the mechanism facilitates finger movements, demonstrating a sophisticated design approach.[testo slides + Chat]

Advantages and Limitations:

Recognizing that replicating a prosthesis' weight identical to a human hand can be perceived as excessively heavy for users, we acknowledge the challenge of achieving weights below the human hand's mass due to technological constraints. Therefore, despite striving for reduced weight, we set the reference weight to match that of a human hand, acknowledging the limitations within current electromechanical systems and material technologies.

[Te major improvements provided by this device are the naturalness of forms, movements and orientation of the rotation axes and hand posture. The prosthetic design was devel-oped focusing on the anthropometry of the real human hand, both from an aesthetic and biomechanical point of view, allowing the user to perceive the device as an integral part of the body rather than a simple external tool.][preso dal paper:"s12984-022-01046-y"]

Pattern Recognition:

Hand control relies on pattern recognition. Typically, EMG signals from two sensors, one for the flexor muscle and one for the extensor muscle, are utilized. Noteworthy advancements have been made, optimizing signal detection via experiments, with the NLR algorithm showing optimal performance using minimal electrodes. This optimization not only enhances physical device structure but also reduces costs while improving overall performance. [testo slides + Chat]
