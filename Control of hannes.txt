Myoelectric prosthetic devices represent a real opportunity for enabling upper limb amputees to perform various activities of daily living (ADLs). These prostheses typically exploit flexor and extensor muscles of the wrist through surface electromyographic (EMG) electrodes [1]. Additionally, the level of recorded muscular contraction modulates the speed of the prosthesis, implementing a proportional control [2]. Due to the high complexity of the muscular system, the relationship between EMG signals and upper limb movements is remarkably nonlinear and generally only dual-site control has been employed [3]. Moreover, the prosthesis control is narrowed to the single articulation preventing the simultaneous movement of multiple joints. Indeed, when two or more DoFs are considered, only one joint is controlled at a time, and co-contraction strategies are used to switch between DoFs [4]. Other groups have attempted the direct control of multi-DoF prostheses by implementing a multi amplitude strategy using dual-site electrodes, by thresholding the muscle contraction intensity [5]. However, this strategy is not intuitive, with movements appearing to be clumsy and unnatural, therefore preventing users from feeling the prosthesis as part of their body [6]. In order to overcome these limits, pattern recognition algorithms were adopted by many groups to decode the intended movement, with the final goal of increasing the controllability of multi-DoF prosthetic devices [7]–​[9]. However, current pattern recognition approaches demonstrated poor performance with DoFs higher than 2 [10]. Another limitation of these studies is that the outcomes achieved during laboratory experiments are poorly assessed in real ADL applications [2]. Therefore, there is an urgent need of a reliable and stable classifier able to deal with unknown situations typical of ADLs [11]–​[14]. We addressed this challenge by implementing a pattern recognition control specifically optimized for the Hannes system, a novel polyarticulated hand prosthesis [15], to generate a robust, intuitive and human-like simultaneous DoFs control. Concerning the previous work where only hand opening and closing were actively controlled [15], we here include the classification of other two DoFs of the wrist. We optimized and tested several pattern recognition algorithms that process information coming solely from the EMG electrodes embedded in the prosthetic device. We then implemented the resulting best performing algorithm for simultaneous online control of the Hannes system joints. Our group already tested pattern recognition algorithms for translating muscular activity into virtual hand movements in 2 DoFs only (rest, hand opening-closing (HOC), wrist pronation-supination (WPS)) [16]. We here extend this work by including the detection of wrist flexion-extension (WFE) for the real-time control of the Hannes prosthesis [16]. We assessed the performance of the detection algorithms for the control of the Hannes prosthetic hand both with 10 healthy subjects and with 3 trans-radial amputees. The examined classifiers were: Non-Linear Logistic Regression (NLR) [17], Regularized Least-Square (RLS) [18], Artificial Neural Network (ANN) [19], Support Vector Machine (SVM) [20], and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) [17]. For NLR, RLS and LDA methods, we combined pattern recognition with an "abstention" criterion. This consists in evaluating the likelihood of the decoded joint movement and enabling an "abstention" criterion (i.e. confidence-based rejection) [21]. The hyperparameters calibration and the integration of abstention inside each algorithm greatly improved the classifier accuracy. The increased number of DoFs to be simultaneously classified could lead to lower algorithms accuracy with respect to simpler settings [15], [16], nevertheless we here show that performances were still suitable for prosthetic control. We also found that both for amputees and able-bodied subjects, the NLR outperformed the other classifiers.
